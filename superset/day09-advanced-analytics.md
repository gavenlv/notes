    COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM sales_data
WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY region, product_category, subcategory
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

2. **Sunburst Chart Setup**:
```sql
-- Nested category data for sunburst

    SELECT 
        'All Products' as level_1,
        product_category as level_2,
        subcategory as level_3,
        SUM(sales_amount) as value
    FROM sales_data
    WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01'
    GROUP BY product_category, subcategory
)
SELECT * FROM category_hierarchy;
```

3. **Box Plot Data**:
```sql
